            <h1>CancerVax is a pre-clinical biotech company developing a novel Universal Cancer Treatment Platform that will be customizable as an injection, to treat many types of cancer. Powered by artificial intelligence, our revolutionary approach DETECTS, MARKS, and KILLS only cancer cells using the body’s own immune system. Other immunotherapies have had very limited success trying to teach the immune system how to recognize cancer cells. Instead, we intend to make cancer cells look like a common disease that it already recognizes, such as measles, and “trick” the body into killing these “disguised” cancer cells with strength. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a shot.</h1>

                <p>Flashpoint was founded on nanotechnology developed over the past 10 years in the laboratory of Chad Mirkin, Director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern University and 2024 winner of the prestigious Kavli Prize in Nanoscience. <strong>Flashpoint’s groundbreaking nanotechnology discovery platform</strong> enables the development of therapeutic candidates with superior product profiles. Validated in numerous in-vivo models, this technology has transformed components that are ineffective in conventional formulations into curative cancer immunotherapies. CancerVax is working with Flashpoint to deliver its novel Universal Cancer Treatment therapies using Flashpoint’s nanoparticle technology.
