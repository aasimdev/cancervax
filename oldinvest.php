                            <h3>The Old Way of Treating Cancer
                            </h3>
                            <div class="prob-block">
                                <p>For decades, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been the standards of care for cancer treatment, and often the only options. They operate on the basic premise that cancer cells are fast growing cells, so using powerful toxic chemicals (chemotherapy) or powerful x-rays (radiation) they hope to kill those cells to stop the cancer.
                                </p>
                                <p>The problem is that these treatments are not always very targeted, so they also kill normal fast-growing cells, such as hair cells, intestine cells, mouth-lining cells and others. This inadvertent side effect of killing healthy cells is what causes the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, and a reduced quality of life for cancer patients.</p>
                                <p>Using “chemo” has been likened to throwing a grenade into the body with the hope that it will kill the cancer and not the body.
                                </p>

                            <h4>The Problem​</h4>

                                <li>The body’s immune system is very good at killing foreign pathogens, such as the measles virus. But it’s not very good at killing cancer cells because cancer cells were originally normal cells and not foreign pathogens. This is why cancer grows undetected and is so hard to treat.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>The Solution​</h4>

                                <li>We are developing a novel technology that will precisely detect cancer cells
                                    and force them to produce special proteins to “look” like common diseases
                                    for which a strong immunity already exists – such as measles or chickenpox.
                                    Then, the immune system will automatically destroy these disguised cancer
                                    cells as if they were known foreign pathogens. </li>
                                <li class="mt-4">Our technology is packaged into a nanoparticle that is programmable to seek out only cancer cells and uses a novel 2-step strategy to precisely detect cancer cells.</li>

                            <p>Cancer immunotherapy is the next generation weapon in the fight against cancer. It uses the body’s own immune system to target and kill cancer cells. 

                            </p>
                            <p>Pharmaceutical research is booming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the medical community learned how to use mRNA to recognize and fight specific disease states.
                            </p>

                            <p>CancerVax is using a “Smart mRNA” concept to create a novel cancer immunotherapy treatment that uses a patient’s immune system to detect, mark, and kill cancer -- a better way to fight cancer.
