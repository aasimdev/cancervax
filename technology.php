            <h1>Universal Cancer Treatment Platform</h1>
        </div>

        <p>We are developing a novel Universal Cancer Treatment Platform that will be customizable, as an injection, to treat many types of cancer.

            ​​</p>


        <p>Our innovative approach <strong>DETECTS, MARKS, and KILLS</strong> only cancer cells. By making cancer cells “look” like well immunized diseases such as measles or chickenpox, we intend to harness the body’s natural immunity to easily kill cancer cells. For example, anyone who has had measles, or been vaccinated for measles, has lifetime immunity to the disease.

            ​</p>
        <p>Our form of treatment is known as <strong>cancer immunotherapy, or therapeutic cancer vaccines</strong>.​</p>
        <p>Cancer immunotherapy is the latest weapon in the war against cancer, with a forecasted market size of $153 Billion by 2027 (Reports and Data). It is less toxic than chemotherapy and radiation, and less radical than surgery.

            ​</p>
        <p>Our novel approach is fundamentally different than other treatments and we believe this is a “Better Way to Fight Cancer.”

            ​</p>

                <h3>The Problem​</h3>
                <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
                    <li>The body’s immune system is very good at killing foreign pathogens, such as the measles virus. But it’s not very good at killing cancer cells because cancer cells were originally normal cells and not foreign pathogens. This is why cancer grows undetected and is so hard to treat.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Solution​</h3>
                <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
                    <li>We are developing a novel technology that will precisely detect cancer cells
                        and force them to produce special proteins to “look” like common diseases
                        for which a strong immunity already exists – such as measles or chickenpox.
                        Then, the immune system will automatically destroy these disguised cancer
                        cells as if they were known foreign pathogens. </li>
                    <li class="mt-4">Our technology is packaged into a nanoparticle that is programmable to seek out only cancer cells and uses a novel 2-step strategy to precisely detect cancer cells.</li>

                    <ul class="theme-list m-4">
                        <li>Step 1 - Detect cell surface markers <strong>outside the cell</strong></li>
                        <li>Step 2 - Detect cancer genetic signatures <strong>inside the cell</strong>​</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>Our technology is packaged into a nanoparticle, very much like the COVID-19 vaccine. </p>
                <p>Unlike any other approach, our nanoparticles are programmable to seek out <strong>only cancer cells</strong>, then mark them for destruction.</p>
