            <h1>Universal Cancer Treatment Platform</h1>
        </div>

        <p>We are developing a novel Universal Cancer Treatment Platform that will be customizable, as an injection, to treat many types of cancer. ​​</p>


        <p>Our innovative approach <strong>DETECTS, MARKS, and KILLS</strong> only cancer cells. By making cancer cells “look” like well immunized diseases such as COVID-19, measles, or chickenpox, we intend to harness the body’s natural immunity to easily kill cancer cells. For example, anyone who has had chickenpox, or been vaccinated for chickenpox, has lifetime immunity to the disease.​</p>
        <p>Our form of treatment is known as <strong>cancer immunotherapy, or therapeutic cancer vaccines</strong>.​</p>
        <p>Cancer immunotherapy is the latest weapon in the war against cancer, with a forecasted market size of $153 Billion by 2027 (Reports and Data). It is less toxic than chemotherapy and radiation, and less radical than surgery. ​</p>
        <p>Our novel approach is fundamentally different than other treatments and we believe this is a “Better Way to Treat Cancer”.​</p>

        <h3>The Problem​</h3>
        <p>Cancer cells are very good at avoiding detection. Many cancer vaccines today can only detect proteins on the surface of cancer cells. Unfortunately, these proteins also appear on healthy cells leading to toxic killing of healthy cells and tissues. </p>

        <h3>The Solution​</h3>
        <p>Our novel approach uses a 2-step precision detection strategy:</p>
        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li>Step 1 - Detect cell surface markers <strong>outside the cell</strong></li>
            <li>Step 2 - Detect cancer genetic signatures <strong>inside the cell</strong>​</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our technology is packaged into a nanoparticle, very much like the COVID-19 vaccine. </p>
        <p>Unlike any other approach, our nanoparticles are programmable to seek out <strong>only cancer cells</strong>, then mark them for destruction.</p>

        <h3>Cancer Cell Detection​</h3>

        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li>A single injection contains billions of CancerVax nanoparticles.</li>
            <li>Each nanoparticle is equipped with detectors to seek out specific cancer cells.</li>
            <li>The nanoparticles latch on to cells with the matching surface protein.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cancer Cell Marking​</h3>

        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li>A Smart mRNA payload is released into the cell.</li>
            <li>If the cell matches the genetic signature in the payload, then the cell is confirmed as the target cancer cell.</li>
            <li>The Smart mRNA then tells the cancer cell to produce proteins associated with well immunized diseases such as, COVID-19, measles, or chickenpox. <strong>This makes cancer cells look like ​
                    common diseases ​
                    to the immune ​
                    system.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cancer Cell Killing​</h3>
        <p>We summon the full power and memory of the body’s existing immunity to attack and kill cancer cells!</p>


        <h3>A Customizable Platform for Many Cancers​</h3>

        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li><strong>Makes cancer cells look like well immunized diseases</strong> (chickenpox, measles, etc.)</li>
            <li>No one in the market is taking this novel approach​</li>
            <li>Novel 2-step precise detection of cancer cells (outside cell signature + inside cell signature)​</li>
            <li>DETECT, MARK, and KILL only cancer cells​</li>
            <li>Proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to find cellular signatures for various cancer types​</li>
            <li>Built on tried-and-true messenger RNA (mRNA) technology​</li>
            <li>Built on tried-and-true lipid nanoparticle technology​</li>
            <li>2 patent applications</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>Ewing Sarcoma​</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Working with UCLA, we have developed a promising drug candidate for treating Ewing Sarcoma.​ </p>

            <p>
            It has been demonstrated in lab tests to kill Ewing Sarcoma cells with good efficiency.​</p>
            <p>  We have an exclusive right to license this drug from UCLA and commercialize it.</p>
