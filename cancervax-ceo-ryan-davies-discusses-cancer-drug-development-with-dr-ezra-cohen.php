        <h3>About Us</h3>

        <p>CancerVAX, Inc., a pre-clinical biotechnology company working with UCLA to develop breakthrough immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Working with a team of experienced cancer researchers and physicians at UCLA, we are developing a pipeline that includes three innovative projects: (1) treating Ewing sarcoma, a deadly children’s cancer, (2) a Universal Cancer Vaccine that will detect, mark, and destroy only cancer cells while leaving healthy cells in-tact, and (3) a low cost Universal CAR-T Cell Platform that can reprogram natural immune T-cells inside the body to seek and destroy targeted cancer cells. All of our immunotherapy technologies are designed to be delivered as injections. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a flu shot – a better way to treat cancer.  </p>
