                            <p> Our cancer treatment is designed to be customizable, administered as a shot, and leverage state-of-the-art bioengineering and molecular technologies.</p>
                            <p> This innovative approach detects, marks, and kills cancer cells exclusively. By inducing cancer cells to express a distinct marker absent in healthy cells, custom antibody drugs and the body's immune cells can precisely target and eradicate cancer cells.</p>

                                <p>In recent years, advances in science and biotechnology have proven that the body’s immune system is very effective at targeting and killing abnormal cells, germs and viruses, and has been doing it since the beginning of time. The problem is that cancer is not a foreign invader and grows much faster than the body’s normal immune response rate.</p>
                                <p>Much like COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, cancer immunotherapies can train the body to target and destroy specific cancer cells. <span> Cancer immunotherapies are also known as cancer treatment vaccines.</span> </p>
                                <p>While there is no such thing as a magic vaccine that can prevent people from getting cancer, we can borrow many of the techniques and technologies from modern preventative flu or COVID vaccines, and use the body’s immune system to target and treat cancers.</p>
                                <p>Our immunotherapy technologies being developed at UCLA are designed to be delivered as simple injections. With our development of a Universal Cancer Vaccine platform, we look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a flu shot – <span>We believe immunotherapy is a better way to treat cancer.</span></p>

                                <p>Our UCAR-T Cell platform is a novel and customizable low-cost cancer treatment platform, delivered as a shot, that can reprogram natural immune T-cells inside the body to seek and destroy targeted cancer cells. These modified T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells. Conventional CAR-T Cell therapy can cost more than $500,000 per dose due to complicated and expensive lab processes. Our goal is to lower the cost to a few thousand dollars per dose by helping the body make its own CAR T-cells.</p>

                                <p>Our Universal Cancer Vaccine platform and our UCAR-T Cell platform can be used separately, however, when used together, we believe that we can kill cancer cells with extreme precision using the body’s immune system at very low costs. Our Universal Cancer Vaccine platform detects and marks a unique target our UCAR-T Cell platform makes T-cells that attack that target.</p>

                            <h5>Let's Beat Cancer</h5>
                            <p>Pharmaceutical research is booming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the medical community learned how to use mRNA to recognize and fight specific disease states. A similar concept is being applied by CancerVAX to create immunotherapy treatments with the purpose of using a patient’s immune system to detect, mark, and kill cancer.</p>

                                <p> The CancerVAX business model involves partnering with experienced cancer research institutions, like UCLA, to develop new life-changing drugs, followed by plans to license and/or sell the company’s drugs, or license technologies to major pharmaceutical companies. <br><br> As a biotech company, CancerVAX’s goal is to create value for our company and our shareholders at every step of incremental success we make on the path to FDA approval.</p>
                                <p>From discovery, to optimization, to pre-clinical trials, and additional future phases (phase 1 clinical trials, phase 2 clinical trials, phase 3 clinical trials), every step is a value inflection point that CancerVAX believes could increase the company’s value and bring it one step closer to curing cancer.
