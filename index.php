                        <p>Working with a world-class team of experienced cancer researchers and physicians at UCLA, we are creating a breakthrough Universal Cancer Treatment platform.</p>
                        <p> This cancer treatment is designed to be customizable, be administered as a shot, and leverage state-of-the-art bioengineering and molecular technologies.</p>
                        <p> Our innovative approach detects, marks, and kills cancer cells exclusively. By inducing cancer cells to express a distinct marker absent in healthy cells, custom antibody drugs and the body's immune cells can precisely target and eradicate cancer cells.</p>
                        <p> Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US, following heart disease. While we don’t have a solution to prevent cancer, our objective is to develop our Universal Cancer Treatment platform so that it can be customized to treat a broad spectrum of cancer types and substantially decrease the number of cancer-related fatalities.</p>

                            <p>We have created our first cancer drug candidate – a single-disease specific immunotherapy targeting Ewing sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer primarily affecting children and young adults. Unfortunately, the death rate for patients with recurrent Ewing sarcoma is nearly 100%. 

​<br><br>

Based on the positive data, we may launch FDA IND enabling studies needed to apply for approval to proceed with human trials. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a flu shot – a better way to treat cancer.

                            system to target and eliminate cancer cells. The UCV will use cutting edge
                            bioengineering and molecular technologies to uniquely detect, mark and kill only cancer
                            cells. By forcing cancer cells to express a unique marker that healthy cells do not
                            have, custom antibody drugs and the body's immune system can target and destroy them
                            with precision. Additionally, we intend to make cancer cells look like common diseases so
                            that the body’s immune system can easily destroy them. We have filed a patent
                            application for the UCV and are working with UCLA to develop the platform, which may
                            be administered as a one or two-shot treatment.</p>
