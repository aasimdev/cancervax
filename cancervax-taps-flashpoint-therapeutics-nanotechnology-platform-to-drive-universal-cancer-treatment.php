        <h3>Research Agreement Leverages Structural Nanomedicine to Develop Cancervax’s Advanced Cancer Therapies</h3>
        <p>Santa Barbara, CA, August 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cancervax, Inc., the developer of a breakthrough universal cancer treatment platform that will use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, today announced that the Company has entered into a research agreement with Flashpoint Therapeutics to perform research on its newly patent-pending Universal Cancer Treatment platform. </p>

        <p>"We are very excited about this opportunity to work with the world-class research team at Flashpoint Therapeutics,” said Byron Elton, Cancervax CEO. “Flashpoint’s researchers and its proprietary technology will help us continue to develop our Universal Cancer Treatment platform.” </p>

        <p>Cancervax recently filed a patent application for its novel Universal Cancer Treatment platform that will be customizable, as an injection, to treat many types of cancer. Our innovative approach DETECTS, MARKS, and KILLS only cancer cells. By making cancer cells “look” like well immunized common diseases such as measles or chickenpox, we intend to use the body’s natural immune system to easily kill the cancer cells. </p>

        <p>Adam Margolin, CEO of Flashpoint said, "This project aligns perfectly with Flashpoint's mission to leverage our structural nanomedicine platform to develop complex and intelligent therapeutics. Cancervax's Universal Cancer Treatment platform requires precise, multi-component delivery to effectively detect and mark cancer cells. Our technology is uniquely suited to this challenge, offering the ability to package and deliver Smart mRNA payloads with the efficiency and accuracy needed to realize the full potential of this promising therapeutic approach." </p>
