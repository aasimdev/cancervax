        <h3>Recent in-vitro lab results confirm that the Company’s Smart mRNA can be used as a potential on/off switch for selectively detecting cancer cells</h3>
        <p>Lehi, Utah – December 20, 2024 – CancerVax, Inc., the developer of a breakthrough universal cancer treatment (UCT) platform that will use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, today announced the successful functional validation of its innovative Smart mRNA (messenger RNA) technology in lab tests.  </p>

        <p>The Company’s novel approach detects and universally marks cancer cells as common diseases such as measles. This tricks the natural immune system into mounting a strong immune response and kills cancer cells as if they were measles. The CancerVax technology uses a precision 2-step cancer detection mechanism in a highly functionalized nanoparticle.   </p>

        <p>Step 1: the nanoparticle latches onto cells with surface proteins highly expressed on cancer cells. Step 2: the nanoparticle releases a proprietary Smart mRNA payload that is conditionally activated based on natural genetic signatures. When the Smart mRNA encounters a cancer-specific signature, it forces the cancer cell to start producing measle proteins, which disguises the cancer cell as measles and attracts the immune cells. When it encounters a healthy cell signature, the Smart mRNA will not turn on, leaving the healthy cell un-harmed. This on/off cancer signature detection is a very exciting feature that we believe will improve the efficacy and safety of our treatment.    </p>

        <p>Since August 2024, the Company has been working with Flashpoint Therapeutics to leverage its Structural Nanomedicine (SN) system to deliver and confirm the on/off functionality of the CancerVax Smart mRNAs.   </p>

        <p>Recent positive lab confirmation of Smart mRNA functionality is a tremendous milestone for the Company. This marks a significant step in CancerVax’s mission to develop effective treatments for hard-to-treat cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).</p>

        <h3>Goals of the Flashpoint Collaboration:</h3>

        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li>Demonstrate the successful incorporation of our Smart mRNA payload into Flashpoint SNAs</li>
            <li>Confirm that Smart mRNAs can be delivered into cancer cells and non-cancerous cells</li>
            <li>Confirm that Smart mRNAs can be turned on and off by introducing the expected genetic signatures</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Results:</strong> CancerVax’s Smart mRNA performed as expected!</p>

        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li>Smart mRNAs were successfully delivered to pancreatic, lung, Ewing sarcoma, and breast cancer cell lines, as well as a positive control non-cancerous cell line with very high transfection rate.</li>
            <li>In all the above cell lines, Smart mRNAs were successfully turned off when the corresponding genetic signature was added.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These results biologically validate the Company’s Smart mRNA technology and provide a strong foundation for the next phases of development.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps in Development</h3>
        <p>With this successful validation, CancerVax will now advance to the following milestones:</p>

        <ul class="theme-list mb-4">
            <li>Creation of cell-targeting nanoparticles to perform Step 1 functionality.</li>
            <li>Development of an optimized Smart mRNA that specifically detects PDAC (Pancreatic Cancer) cells, and make it look like measles</li>
            <li>Integration of these components into the complete CancerVax therapeutic nanoparticle</li>
            <li>Perform in-vivo mouse model testing for PDAC treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dr. Adam Grant, Principal Scientist of CancerVax said, “These results are very exciting and confirm that CancerVax is on the right path. With these experiments under our belt, I’m confident that we can harness Smart mRNA technology to specifically deliver our mRNA payload to cancer cells while significantly reducing harmful side effects in healthy cells. I’m thrilled that we were able to achieve the development of a Smart mRNA on our first try. To me, this suggests that the natural biological mechanism we are exploiting for our Smart mRNA technology is very robust and will eventually allow us to help cancer patients across numerous cancer types, not just PDAC patients. We still have work to do, but this is a huge step for us in developing a novel cancer treatment platform that has the potential to drastically improve the lives of cancer patients.”</p>

        <p>Dr. George Katibah, Chief Scientific Officer of CancerVax said, “These exciting results provide important proof of principle for our Smart mRNA technology’s ability to limit expression to cells with a specific genetic signature such as tumor cells while sparing normal tissue. We are now developing an optimized therapeutic mRNA for PDAC that will direct the immune systems to selectively target pancreatic tumor cells by forcing the tumor to express measles proteins. We hope to extend our current results to demonstrate our platform’s ability to activate human immune cells. “Current therapies like personalized cancer vaccines have fundamental limitations with the need to be tailored to each patient and overcome biological barriers to develop a new immune response. Our approach is distinct as it unlocks the immune system’s robust pre-existing ability to fight pathogens across different patients’ immune systems.”</p>


        <h3>About Cancervax</h3>

        <p>CancerVax, Inc. is a pre-clinical biotechnology company developing a novel Universal Cancer Treatment platform that will be customizable, as an injection, to treat many types of cancer. Our innovative approach DETECTS, MARKS, and KILLS only cancer cells. By making cancer cells “look” like well immunized common diseases such as measles or chickenpox, we intend to use the body’s natural immune system to easily kill the cancer cells. We have also created our first cancer drug candidate – a single-disease specific immunotherapy targeting Ewing sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer primarily affecting children and young adults. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a shot – a better way to treat cancer.
