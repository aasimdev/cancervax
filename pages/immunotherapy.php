        <p class="text-custom-teal-200 text-2xl leading-8">Cancer generally refers to a collection of diseases where cells in the body divide uncontrollably and spread into surrounding tissues, causing internal damage and often death.</p>

                    <p class="text-black text-base leading-relaxed">For decades, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been the standards of care for cancer treatment and are often the only options. They operate on the basic premise that cancer cells are fast-growing cells, so using powerful toxic chemicals (chemotherapy) or powerful X-rays (radiation), they hope to kill those cells to stop the cancer. The problem is that these treatments are not always very targeted, so they also kill normal fast-growing cells, such as hair cells, intestine cells, mouth-lining cells, and others. This inadvertent side effect of killing healthy cells is what causes the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy and radiation and a reduced quality of life for cancer patients. <br><br>

                        Using “chemo” has been likened to throwing a grenade into the body with the hope that it will kill the cancer and not the body.</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
            <p class="text-black text-base leading-relaxed">Conversely, immunotherapy is like using a sniper rifle to shoot and kill only the cancer cells.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black text-base leading-relaxed">
                In recent years, advances in science and biotechnology have proven that the body’s own immune system is quite effective at targeting and killing abnormal cells, germs and viruses, and has been doing it since the beginning of time. The main problem is that cancer grows at a much faster rate than the body’s normal immune response rate.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black text-base leading-relaxed">
                Much like vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy other diseases, cancer vaccines can train the body to target and destroy specific cancer cells. Cancer vaccines are also known as vaccine therapy or immunotherapy. They are different from vaccines that prevent disease, as they are designed to fight cancer that already exists in the body.
