        <p>Santa Barbara, CA, August 1, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cancervax, Inc., the developer of breakthrough cancer drugs that will use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, today announced that the Company has added two key members to its cancer research team. Dr. Jonathan Lakey will serve as Chief Scientific Advisor and Dr. Adam Grant will serve as Principal Scientist.   </p>

        <p>"We are thrilled to announce the addition of these two distinguished scientists to the Cancervax team,” said Byron Elton, Cancervax CEO.     </p>

Dr. Grant graduated from Brigham Young University with a BS in bioinformatics and obtained a PhD in cancer biology from the University of Arizona. Dr. Grant was the inventor of a software patent that improves neoantigen detection. This patent has been licensed to improve CAR-T cell detection of cancer cells. During his professional career, Dr. Grant has been heavily involved in the immunotherapy space, striving to identify cancer patients who will benefit from combination therapy of anti-pd-1 inhibition and Treg reduction through CCR4 inhibition. His expertise will be invaluable in fostering a collaborative and innovative research environment.”   </p>
