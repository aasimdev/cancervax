                By leveraging cutting-edge bioengineering and molecular technologies, we are on a quest to develop a breakthrough Universal Cancer Vaccine. Similar to the way COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing a universal cancer vaccine that uses the body’s immune system to detect, mark and destroy cancer cells.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>As we search for a universal cancer vaccine, we are also developing conventional immunotherapy treatments. One program, performed at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, is targeted at treating Ewing Sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. There is currently no FDA approved treatment for recurrence. We intend to become a dominant player in the immunotherapy space by partnering with leading researchers and institutions to develop a robust portfolio of cancer vaccines. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a flu shot.
