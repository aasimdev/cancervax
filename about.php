            <h1>CancerVax, Inc. is a pre-clinical biotechnology company creating a better way to treat cancer. Working with a team of world class cancer researchers and practicing oncologists at UCLA, we are developing a breakthrough Universal Cancer Treatment platform that will leverage the body’s immune system to detect, mark, and destroy only cancer cells. We have created our first cancer drug candidate – a single-disease specific immunotherapy targeting Ewing sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer primarily affecting children and young adults. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a shot – a better way to treat cancer. </h1>

                By leveraging cutting-edge bioengineering and molecular technologies, we are on a quest to develop innovative precision cancer immunotherapies that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Inspired by the way vaccines train the body to recognize and destroy the other the diseases, we are developing cancer treatment vaccines, also known as vaccine therapy or immunotherapy, which are a type of treatment that can help the immune system identify and attack cancer cells. They are different from vaccines that prevent disease, as they are designed to treat cancer that already exists in the body. </p>

                        <p>Under the terms of a Sponsored Research Agreement, we began working with UCLA in early 2021 on a single-disease
immunotherapy targeted at Ewing Sarcoma, a deadly children’s
cancer. Existing immunotherapies target natural cancer cell
markers, which unfortunately appear in healthy cells as well,
resulting in the destruction of healthy cells and causing various
levels of toxicity and side effects.<br><br>
In 2024, we announced that our UCLA research team had created a promising new drug candidate for treating recurrent Ewing sarcoma. Based on the positive data, we may to launch FDA IND enabling studies needed to apply for approval to proceed with human trials.
<br><br>
In late 2021,
CancerVax developed the concept of a customizable Universal Cancer
Treatment platform that can potentially target cancer cells with
a high degree of precision and force only the cancer cells to
express a unique marker that we can easily target for destruction.
In 2022, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with UCLA to help develop our Universal Cancer Treatment platform.<br><br>
The Universal Cancer Treatment project has progressed methodically with the development of
various innovative technologies, including a foundational
nanoparticle technology which can be programmed to target
specific cells and deliver customized cargos.

                                <br><br>
                                CAR-T cell therapy is a type of FDA-approved immunotherapy in which a patient’s T-cells are genetically modified in the laboratory, then reinjected back into the patient, so they will bind to specific proteins (antigens) found on cancer cells and kill them. These modified T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells. Conventional CAR-T Cell therapy can cost more than $500,000 per dose due to complicated and expensive lab processes. We believe we can dramatically lower the cost to a few thousand dollars per dose by simply helping the body make its own CAR T-cells.

Prior to that, he was the Director of the Comprehensive Tissue Bank at the University of Alberta. Dr. Lakey is most well-known for co-inventing the “Edmonton Protocol”, along with Dr. James Shapiro, which aided in the improvement of islet isolation techniques for patients with Type 1 diabetes, a recognized major advancement in the treatment of diabetes. The Edmonton Protocol allows patients to receive islet transplants from the enzymes of cadavers and has had a success rate of over 75%. This development has informed treatments for diabetic patients, but has also opened the door for similar treatments for patients with cancer who have compromised organs from the disease or from chemotherapy and radiation. Dr. Lakey has done extensive research in the fields of oncology, stem cells and organ transplantation. He is the recipient of the Outstanding Leadership in Science Award from Alberta Science & Technology, Outstanding Achievement Award from the Canadian Diabetes Association, Awards from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons and was honored with the Meritorious Service Medal (2005) by the Governor-General of Canada.

Dr. Grant graduated from Brigham Young University with a BS in bioinformatics and obtained a PhD in cancer biology from the University of Arizona. His research interests are focused on identifying which cancer patients will respond to specific therapeutics based on their molecular profiles. During his time as a graduate student, Dr. Grant was the inventor of a software patent that improves neoantigen detection. This patent has been licensed to improve CAR-T cell detection of cancer cells. He is also a co-inventor of a gene-signature patent that strives to identify which breast cancer patients are at high risk for bone metastases, suggesting a clinical benefit from antifibrotic drugs like Nintedanib. During his professional career, Dr. Grant has been heavily involved in the immunotherapy space, striving to identify cancer patients who will benefit from combination therapy of anti-pd-1 inhibition and Treg reduction through CCR4 inhibition.</p>
